When using the CLI, it will always prompt you to choose which type of command you want to run at the start. You can also immediately exit the code. All responses will be via the command line and it will ask you to give either a number or words th represent what you want to do with the command. For certain commands it will ask you what you will say after the WHERE clause and that is to allow more creativity with prompts. When doing the Where clause part and need to use a string, make sure to use single quotes instead of double quotes or else the code will get confused.
